# mazerepair

Simple Game in React.JS + Spring Boot. Given a matrix of tiles, rotate them so that all tiles' connections connect to their neighbors.

Ready for deployment to Heroku. (That's where an example deployment is running -- [take a look](https://maze-repair.herokuapp.com)!)

Uses a [Spring Boot/React.JS starter](https://github.com/wolfisolutions-tech/spring-react-starter) as the initial frame.
